# Crawl control for websites

_Understanding disallow, noindex, and nofollow and when to use them._

## 📖 Definitions

**Disallow** is set in `/robots.txt` while `noindex` and `nofollow` are set on the `<meta>` element.

- Disallow → don’t look at it 🙈
- noindex  → don’t index it 🙊
- nofollow → don’t crawl the links on it 🚫🕷️
